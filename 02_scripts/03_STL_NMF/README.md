# STL NMF

Code for Spatial Transcriptomics Learned Non-negative Matrix Factorization. deepNMF.py is the model which is trained with train.py and tested with test.py.

deepNMF_rf and train_rf are for a reference free version of STL_NMF that learns B. **Outdated**.

Files in _synth_grid_ are an implementation of STL NMF for ruitao's generated data (4 regions whihc is why separate code is needed).

Spatial Transcriptomics Learned Non-negative Matrix Factorization.
I will add the papers once we hear back from ICIP.

The folders and code should be relatively well labeled and documented.
If there are any questions, email me at gsk49@case.edu or grant.konkel1@gmail.com.

**IMPORTANT:** Many python/R files will likely have incorrect path imports as I refactored the repo without changing the imports. Some files may have also been renamed. However, it _should_ be pretty clear which files are needed and where those are located, but if not please ask. Many files are outdated and reference older versions of files - be cautious of imports.
